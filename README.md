Thesis Template Master

Welcome to the Thesis Template Master repository! This project was initially developed by Zeinab Seifoori, a dedicated and talented software engineer who created a robust and user-friendly template for academic theses.

Recognizing the potential for further improvements, Mehran Morabbi Pazoki took the initiative to rewrite and debug the template. Mehran's contributions have greatly enhanced the template's functionality, making it even more efficient and reliable.

This repository contains all the necessary files and instructions to get you started on your thesis. It's designed to be easy to use, but if you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

We hope this template helps you in your academic journey. Happy writing!
